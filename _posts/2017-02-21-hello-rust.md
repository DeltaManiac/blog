## Rust ? What ??
You may be wondering why on gods name am I reading about something known as Rust, pshh.... its just metal with some extra O<sub>2</sub> molecues.
Well let me stop you right there my friend, we are not dealing with the chemical reaction known as Rust but a more Programmatical construct.

### Enter Rust-Lang
<img src="{{"../assets/img/rust/rust-logo.png"}}" />

Blatantly copy pasted decription from the Rust lang <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">homepage</a> below

```
Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. 
```
### How does Rust achieve that ?

Well the short version is that it becomes a constant pain in the $$$ by virtie not allowing your code to compile. A simple yet elegant solution.

The thing that attracted me to Rust Lang was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/414ln9/hello_do_you_have_a_moment_to_hear_about_our_lord/">reddit post.</a>

My relationship with rust has been more of a love-hate one, I've many a times found my self shouting expletives at the compiler asking it to compile, but after all the misery it put me through I still kind of like the language and which is why in my *freetime* I thought to port an existing application I wrote from PHP to Rust from scratch.

Until next time..
